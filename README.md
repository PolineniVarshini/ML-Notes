# ML-Notes
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML has many applications in various domains, such as natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, recommender systems, and more.

ML consists of three main types of learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is the process of learning from labeled data, such as images with captions or emails with spam or not spam labels. Unsupervised learning is the process of learning from unlabeled data, such as customer transactions or social media posts. Reinforcement learning is the process of learning from trial and error, such as a robot learning to navigate a maze or a game agent learning to play chess.

ML involves various tasks and techniques, such as regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, and optimization. Each of these tasks and techniques deals with different aspects of machine learning, such as modeling, data processing, performance measurement, and improvement.
